<h1>Staff Developers<a class="headerlink" href="#staff-developers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As a core committer at Mattermost you are responsible for one of the world&#8217;s largest and most popular open source projects. Your work impacts thousands of organizations who depend on Mattermost for daily operations, from high tech (Intel, Samsung, Micron), to healthcare (Medtronic, Epic, Bristol-Myers Squibb) to public sector (U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Energy), to education (University of California, National University of Singapore), and consumer brands (Urban Outfitters, Wargaming.net).</p>
<p>Working in open source means your work is publicly visible. Your code will receive both credit and critique from the community and with the right mindset and support that can lead to you making the best engineering decisions of your career.</p>
<p>Core committers include volunteer developers from the community, staff by organizations deploying and investing in Mattermost, as well as staff paid by Mattermost, Inc.</p>
<p>This document summarizes the resposibilities and requirements of core committers employed by Mattermost, Inc., skill level requirements and hiring process. Staff developers work closely with Mattermost product management to envision, design, plan, develop, coordinate, review and merge improvements per our <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html">contribution guidelines</a> on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Ideally, developers are &#8220;full stack&#8221;, and comfortable moving across backend and frontend projects. As part of our <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#learn-master-teach">learn, master, teach</a> mindset, our environment has people consistently cross-training, becoming experts and passing on knowledge to new team members rotating into new areas of responsibility. That said, we also welcome engineers who prefer to specialize in backend and frontend, since there&#8217;s ample projects to find in both areas.</p>

<p>Both declined and accepted candidates will be invited to share feedback on their hiring experience so we can continually improve our process.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Application/Email - Review of code samples</strong> - In <a class="reference external" href="https://jobs.lever.co/mattermost/">your application</a> we welcome you to include links to any public open source work you&#8217;ve done, including GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket profiles. If you&#8217;d like to share privately we can send you our ID for GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket, or we can review code you send in via email. If you really want to impress us, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html">make a contribution to our open source project by completing a Help Wanted ticket.</a></li>
<li><strong>Email - Follow-up questions</strong> - If your code samples look good, we&#8217;ll email you some questions specific to the role.</li>
<li><strong>Video call - Screening interview</strong> - Selected candidates will be invited for a 25-minute screening call with a recruiter.</li>
<li><strong>Video call - Soft-skills discussion</strong> - Next, candidates will be invited to schedule a 25-minute interview with a core committer to assess soft skills and for the candidate to learn more about the role.</li>
<li><strong>Paid Simulation</strong> - Successful candidates with limited experience contributing to Mattermost are offered a paid project to simulate the experience of working as a core committer. See below for description for <em>Paid Simulation</em> for details.</li>
<li><strong>Reference Checks</strong> - You&#8217;ll be sent an email request by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.skillsurvey.com/">SkillSurvey</a> to list 3 references who can verify your past achievements.</li>
<li><strong>Video call - CTO interview</strong> - Candidates are invited to a 45-minute interview with our CTO and co-creator of the Mattermost open source project.

<li>Staff developers in the US are typically offered full-time employment through a U.S. co-employer, with local payroll via TriNet, benefits and W2 tax reporting.</li>
<li>Staff developers outside the U.S. and Canada are offered full-time consulting paperwork very similar to the click-sign agreement for the paid simulation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Paid Simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Similar to other open source companies, for candidates who successfully complete technical and soft-skills reviews, and who have limited experience contributing to Mattermost, we offer a paid simulation.</p>
<p>The simulation helps candidates experience working on one of the world&#8217;s largest open source projects to understand how they would enjoy such a role should they decide to join the company. Your code will be reviewed and used by hundreds of other contributing developers. After a vetting process, successful projects are merged and the results of your simulation will be deployed by thousands of companies around in the world.</p>
<p>Your work will become a permanent part of the open source project that you can reference for the rest of your career. You&#8217;re also eligible to receive a <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mattermug&amp;src=typd">Mattermost Mug</a> in appreciation of your first contribution.</p>
<p>The simulation project reflects an investment from the core committers to work with the candidate through a series of significant contributions, answering questions, providing input and reviewing code as needed. It also reflects an investment from the candidate to explore the experience of working at Mattermost.</p>
<p>The paid simulation project typically consists of a collection of challenging <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/platform/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%5BHelp+Wanted%5D+is%3Aopen">Help Wanted tickets</a> to be completed per the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html">Mattermost contribution guidelines</a> in a mutually agreed timeline reflecting 30-40 hours of development at the estimated skill level of the candidate.</p>
<p>A flat rate of $750 USD is offered to attempt the simulation project. This amount is a standard fee for simulations and not an indicator of the final offer that would be extended to a successful candidate. A <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit#heading=h.u3m8fmn6xapr">standard click-sign services agreement</a> is used to accept the fee. The fee is paid regardless of whether the project is completed.</p>

<h3>Do you have internships?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-you-have-internships" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While we no longer offer internships for developers, if you get a couple of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=org%3Amattermost+state%3Aopen+Help+Wanted&amp;type=Issues&amp;ref=searchresults?">Help Wanted</a> pull requests accepted, we&#8217;ll interview you for one. This will be a remote internship without supervision; you&#8217;ll only get feedback on your merge requests. If you want to work on open source and qualify <a class="reference external" href="https://jobs.lever.co/mattermost/">please submit an application</a>. In the cover letter field, please note that you want an internship and link to the accepted pull requests. The pull requests should be of significant value and difficulty, which is at the discretion of the hiring manager. For example, fixing 10 typos isn&#8217;t as valuable as shipping 2 new features.</p>
