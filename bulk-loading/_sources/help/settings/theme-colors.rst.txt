Theme Colors
============

The colors of the Mattermost user interface are customizable in **Account Settings > Display > Theme**. You can import your theme colors from Slack, customize the colors yourself, or choose from four standard themes designed by the Mattermost team.

Any changes you make are applied to all teams that you belong to. In Enterprise Edition, you can choose to apply the theme to the current team only, allowing you to have a different theme for each team.

Standard Themes
---------------

Select **Theme Colors** to choose from four standard themes designed by the Mattermost team. To make custom adjustments on the four standard theme colors, click a standard theme and then select **Custom Theme** to load the standard theme into the custom theme color selectors.

Import Theme from Slack
-----------------------

To import a theme, go to **Preferences > Sidebar Theme** from within Slack, open the custom theme option, copy the theme color vector and then paste it into the *Input Slack Theme* input box in Mattermost. Any theme settings that are not customizable in Slack will default to the “Mattermost” standard theme settings.

Custom Themes
-------------

Observe a live preview as you customize theme colors and then click **Save** to confirm your changes. Discard your changes by exiting the settings window and clicking **Yes, Discard**.
